# Restaurant-Manager
A demo for a restaurant management system. The system assists restaurant managers in managing their ingredient inventory. It has basic CRUD funtionalality and was developed using Python Tkinter. There are two main pages on the Restaurant-Manager, "Inventory" and "Order". Both pages have several functionalites

**On the "Inventory" page user can:**
  - View all ingredient in inventory
  - Sort all ingredient too see low stock items
  - Create new ingredient types to inventory (ex. restaurant managers may want to add "peppermint" or "gingerbread" to     inventory during winter)
  - Remove ingredients from inventory (ex. restaurant managers may want to remove "pumpkin spice" from inventory after autumn)

**On the "Orders" page user can:**
  - Order new ingredient to increase stock/ quantity and choose shipping options (1 day shipping, 3 day shipping, etc)
  - View all past orders which include an ID, order date, shipping date, status (pending, shipped, cancelled), ingredient, and quantity
  - Cancel an order if it has not been shipped out yet
  - Users will also be able to see their total spending based on their ordered ingredients and shipping costs displayed at the top of both pages.
